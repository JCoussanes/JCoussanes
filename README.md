### 👋 Hi, I’m Jérôme — developer, toolmaker, and occasional fiction writer.

With 6+ years of experience, I’ve built internal tools for public-sector organizations like fire departments and tourism offices, as well as systems that help dev teams breathe easier.

I love well-crafted code, developer-friendly systems, and tools that just work — and stay maintainable.
My main languages are **Rust**, **Python**, and **TypeScript**.

### 🛠️ I like to build

- Backend APIs & CLI tools  
- Writing & creative tools  
- Minimal, maintainable systems  
- Ethical, open-source software when possible

### 🚀 Actively looking for new opportunities

I'm currently open to:

- **Remote roles** (or local to Besançon, France 🇫🇷)  
- **Backend development**, **CLI tooling**, or **developer experience** work  
- Teams focused on **FOSS**, **green tech**, or **creative ecosystems**

🚫 I tend to avoid roles related to **surveillance tech**, **military**, or **traditional finance**.  
🤷 Domains like **crypto** or **adtech** aren’t my favorite, but I’m open to them for the right mission.

### 📍 Also

- Back from a creative break where I was facilitating writing workshops
- Gradually mirroring selected personal tools from a self-hosted Forgejo instance to GitHub
- I commit under the alias `yther` on some projects
